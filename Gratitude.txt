Gratitude 

I would like to express my deep gratitude to the people who helped create this game.

First of all, I would like to thank Nickel Pavlo (Sprinix) for testing, 
for offering great ideas and supporting the entire development process.
It is a huge contribution to the development of the game.

I wish also to thank Havrylyuk Roman (CoolGuy228), for his wonderful ideas and helpful tests of the game. 
For his personal contribution for my understanding of the player journey in the game.

It wasn't easy to identify and correct mistakes in the system, 
I really appreciate the assistance in that during the final test Korkuna Andriy, Fediuk Andriy Ñ– Nickel Pavlo.

And the last, but not least. I want to thank my parents for their support and care.
